# Improved-Energy-consumption-Prediction
This project enhances energy consumption prediction using hyperparameter-tuned XGBoost and time series analysis on hourly data (between 2008–2016). Key steps include outlier removal, time-based feature creation, and lag features. Model performance was evaluated with RMSE, MAE, and R² via TimeSeriesSplit, reducing RMSE from 3472.21 to 3321.01.
